# Altair---Visual-Data-Analytics
Boonsong Lekagul Wildlife Preserve

The objective is to analyze trends and anomalies in chemical contamination levels across various sensor sites over time using Altair, a Python library for interactive and declarative data visualization. The analysis aims to:

Identify Trends: Visualize and interpret patterns of chemical contamination over time, detecting gradual changes across different sensor locations or shifts in overall contamination levels.
Detect Anomalies: Highlight sudden spikes or drops in contamination levels over time or identify specific sensor sites with significantly different readings compared to others.
Additionally, the analysis will address data quality and uncertainty issues, such as:

Missing Data: Identify gaps in data collection and assess their impact on the analysis.
Changes in Collection Frequency: Evaluate inconsistencies in data recording intervals and their implications for trend detection.
Unrealistic Values: Flag and address erroneous readings, such as extreme values beyond reasonable limits (e.g., water temperature exceeding 100Â°C), which could distort the findings.
By leveraging Altair, this analysis ensures clear, interactive visualizations to effectively explore and communicate contamination patterns while addressing data quality challenges.
